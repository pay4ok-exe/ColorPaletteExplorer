**Note on Images in Markdown:**
Markdown doesn't directly support embedding images from local paths due to security reasons. To include images in your README, you should host your images on a server or use a service like GitHub for image hosting. Once hosted, replace the image link in the markdown syntax as follows:

```markdown
